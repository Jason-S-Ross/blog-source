    "When Trunks got in the time machine, he thought he could change history. However, history in Dragon Ball Z, like git commit objects, is immutable. When he arrived in the past, he created a fork in the timeline. Changes made to the fork didn't affect his own timeline. In the same way, when we did a `git rebase`, we didn't actually change the fork we came from, just created a new one. The other history still exists. In this case, I used `git tag` to tag the commit that Trunks jumped from so that he would be able to return more easily, but we could have also just used the reflog and jumped to a specific commit that way.\n",
