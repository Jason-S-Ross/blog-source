    "# About Rebasing\n",
    "\n",
    "Rebasing is used to rearange commit history in a git repository. \n",
    "We typically think of rebasing as the operation of moving the origin of a branch to a different commit, but it's extremely flexible. \n",
    "One other usage of rebasing is to \"clean up\" or rearrange history along a single branch. \n",
    "Using `git rebase` we can remove commits from our history, edit old commits, or insert new commits into our timeline. \n",
    "However, there's some confusing information about what exactly is going on when we rebase. \n",
    "It's common to see rebase described as re-writing history, but that's not really what's happening under the hood. \n",
    "Rebasing actually leaves all the old git commits alone (remember that git commits are immutable), and creates a whole new history in parallel."

    "# Time Travel\n",
    "\n",
    "Git rebase works a bit like time travel in fiction (depending on the story)\n",
    "Now, there's all kinds of ways time travel can work in fiction. \n",
    "Unfortunately, it doesn't work like _Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure_ (wouldn't it be nice if bug fixes magically appeared as long as you promised to do them later),\n",
    "but fortunately, it doesn't work like _The Terminator_ series either (fixed a bug? Too bad, you will always have that bug because it's fate).\n",
    "The story that demonstrates `git rebase` best is actually from Dragon Ball Z."

    "When Trunks got in the time machine, he thought he could change history. However, history in Dragon Ball Z, like git commit objects, is immutable. When he arrived in the past, he created a fork in the timeline. Changes made to the fork didn't affect his own timeline. In the same way, when we did a `git rebase`, we didn't actually change the timeline we came from; we just created a new one. The other timeline still exists, and we can go back using the reflog (at least until the old timeline gets garbage collected). \n",

    "The real danger of \"rewriting history\" with git if you push a commit to a remote with incompatible history. Suppose we had pushed Goku's death to a remote repository - we'd be \"locked in\" at that point and would have to find some other way to save the future. But as long as we haven't pushed a commit, we're OK to `rebase` and `amend` and `rebase` to our heart's content (as long as we don't leave detached branches around too long - check your `gc.pruneExpire` setting).\n"
